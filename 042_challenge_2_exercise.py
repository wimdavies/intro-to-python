# So far you've spent a lot of time writing new programs.

# This is great for learning the fundamentals of code, but
# actually isn't very realistic. Most software engineers
# spend their time modifying and maintaining existing
# programs, not writing entirely new ones.

# Below is the same program as in the example. Your
# challenge is to implement some improvements:

# 1. Right now users can place their tiles over the other
#    user's tiles. Prevent this.

# 2. Right now if the game reaches a draw with no more free
#    spaces, the game doesn't end. Make it end at that
#    point.

# 3. If you want a real challenge, try to rework this
#    program to support a 5x5 board rather than a 3x3 board.

# 4. If you're still not satisfied, try to rework this
#    program to take a parameter `board_size` and play a
#    game with a board of that size.

# This is getting really challenging now â€” and is entirely
# optional. Don't forget about your assessment!
